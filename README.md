# Java-LawnMower
Project Name
This project is called "Lawn Mower Emulator" and it is a simulation of a lawn mower that can move in different directions, cut grass, and detect the edges of a lawn.

Project Overview
The Lawn Mower Emulator is built using Java programming language and Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles. The project consists of several classes that work together to simulate the lawn mower's movements.

The main components of the project are:

Mower: This class represents the lawn mower and contains its position, direction, motor, grass cutter, and sensor. It also has methods for starting, stopping, and moving the mower.

Motor: This class represents the motor of the lawn mower and has a method for starting it.

GrassCutter: This class represents the grass cutter of the lawn mower and has a method for cutting grass.

Sensor: This class represents the sensor of the lawn mower and has methods for detecting the edges of the lawn.

Direction: This class represents the direction in which the lawn mower can move, such as North, South, East, and West.

MowerState: This is an abstract class that defines the behavior of the mower in different states, such as moving to the right, left, down, or up.

EastState, WestState, SoutheastState, SouthwestState: These are subclasses of the MowerState class that define the behavior of the mower in each state.

Project Setup
To run the Lawn Mower Emulator project, you will need to have Java installed on your computer.

Clone the project from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Raccoon254/lawn-mower-emulator.git

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Compile and run the Main.java file.

You can then control the lawn mower using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

Conclusion
The Lawn Mower Emulator is a fun and interactive project that demonstrates the use of OOD principles and Java programming language. It can be used as a learning tool for those who want to improve their Java skills or understand the basics of Object-Oriented Design.
